- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Sav, @nomadconcepts, Thanks for purchasing my preset! It helps me a lot!

To access your preset pack please download the file to. your phone or computer and open the Zip.
Inside you will see 2 types of files... DNG's and XMP's

XMP's will be for desktop Lightroom users. ( I assume you know how to import the preset)
DNG's will be for mobile Lightroom users. (Instructions below)

**For mobile users!** open the Zip. and select on DNG. file, send the DNG. to the Lightroom app. 
The preset will be part of the preview, and now you can save the preset as a custom one for future use. 
You will have to do this with each DNG in the Zip. üëç 

If you havee any questions please let me know by shooting me a DM on IG @nomadconcepts. or Email me: nomadcofilms@gmail.com

If you enjoy my presets please repost something youve created with my preset and tag me! Would be dope to see what others are creating.
